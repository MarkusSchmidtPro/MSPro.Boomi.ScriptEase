# The lib directory

The `lib` directory contains the `scriptEaseLib-1.0.0.jar` (the ScriptEase Library) that is referenced by the project (see IntelliJ Project References). 

If you have purchased a license, the license file `scriptease.license.json` must be stored in this directory. 

The `scriptease.license`file that appears here is used to cache license information to speed-up starting. If you delete it, it'll be refreshed and the first start will take a bit longer.

## The ScriptEase Library

The ScriptEase Library provides the magic to develop, debug and test Groovy Script for Boomi Integration with IntelliJ.
