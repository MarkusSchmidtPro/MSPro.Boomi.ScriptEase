# Process Execution Properties

This example was a quick "hack" how to use process call chains and `ProcessExecutionProperties`, a quite advanced Boomi topic.

My EMEA PSO colleague _Predrag Dimic_ asked for these implementations which allowed him to test all  scripts in the [EMEA PSO Framework](https://bitbucket.org/boomii/workspace/repositories/?project=%7B19f0f3e2-3cf2-4ce9-94b5-5fc2fcf1957a%7D). Personally I have never come across any requirement where I was using these properties.

In case of any question, please, let me know!
